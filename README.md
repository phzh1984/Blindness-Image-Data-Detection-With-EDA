Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Overview

Millions of people worldwide suffer from diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness among working-aged adults. Aravind Eye Hospital in India is committed to detecting and preventing this disease, especially among individuals in rural areas where medical screening is challenging.

This repository aims to address the challenge of diabetic retinopathy detection by providing a solution based on a large dataset of retina images. These images were captured using fundus photography under various conditions, including different imaging devices and settings.

Dataset Description

Severity Levels

Each retina image in the dataset is labeled with the severity of diabetic retinopathy, rated on a scale of 0 to 4:

0: No DR (No Diabetic Retinopathy)

1: Mild DR

2: Moderate DR

3: Severe DR

4: Proliferative DR

It's essential to note that, like any real-world dataset, the images and labels may contain noise. Images may have artifacts, be out of focus, underexposed, or overexposed. The dataset was gathered from multiple clinics, using various cameras over an extended period, introducing additional variability.
